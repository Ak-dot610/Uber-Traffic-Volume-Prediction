# Uber Traffic Volume Prediction 🚦

This project was completed as part of a Mentor-led internship with Uber in collaboration with Mentormind (Aug 2025 – Oct 2025).  
The goal was to develop a predictive model to forecast hourly traffic volumes at different junctions using historical traffic, weather, and event data.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Internship Provider:** Uber (via Mentormind)  
- **Duration:** Aug 25, 2025 – Oct 09, 2025  
- **Verification No:** MM-21662  
- **Objective:** Build a model to forecast hourly traffic volumes and provide actionable insights for congestion management.

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Removed missing values and duplicates  
   - Converted timestamps and aggregated hourly traffic data  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extracted time-based features (hour, day, month, weekend flag)  
   - Integrated simulated weather & event data  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Trained an **XGBoost regression model**  
   - Evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and R²  

4. **Results & Insights**  
   - Achieved **R² ≈ 0.85 (85% accuracy)**, RMSE ≈ 120 vehicles/hour  
   - Identified **peak congestion hours**: 8–10 AM, 6–8 PM  
   - Seasonal effect: higher congestion during monsoon months
